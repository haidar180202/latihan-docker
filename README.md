- Make sure that you have Docker to installed in your device
  - Windows or macOS:
    [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
  - Linux: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Check the `README.md` of each sample to get more details on the structure and
what is the expected output.
To stop and remove all containers of the sample application run:

```console
docker compose down
```

### Quickstart guides

In addition to all the ready to run Compose samples listed above the folder [official-documentation-samples](official-documentation-samples/README.md) contains quickstart guides. Each of these step by step guides explain which files need to be created to build and run a Docker Compose application.
